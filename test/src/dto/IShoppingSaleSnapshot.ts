/**
 * Snapshot record of sale.
 *
 * `IShoppingSaleSnapshot` is an entity that embodies a snapshot of a sale,
 * and the ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram) describes the role of the
 * `shopping_sale_snapshots` table as follows:
 *
 * > {@link IShoppingSale shopping_sales} is an entity that embodies
 * > "product sales" (sales) information registered by the
 * > {@link IShoppingSeller seller}. And the main information of the sale is
 * > recorded in the sub `shopping_sale_snapshots`, not in the main
 * > {@link IShoppingSale shopping_sales}. When a seller changes a previously
 * > registered item, the existing {@link IShoppingSale shopping_sales} record
 * > is not changed, but a new snapshot record is created.
 * >
 * > This is to preserve the {@link IShoppingCustomer customer}'s
 * > {@link IShoppingOrder purchase history} flawlessly after the customer
 * > purchases a specific item, even if the seller changes the components or price
 * > of the item. It is also intended to support sellers in so-called A/B testing,
 * > which involves changing components or prices and measuring the performance
 * > in each case.
 *
 * By the way, DTO (Data Transfer Object) level used by the front-end developer,
 * it does not distinguish {@link IShoppingSale} and `IShoppingSaleSnapshot`
 * strictly, and generally handles {@link IShoppingSale} and snapshot together.
 *
 * But even though the DTO level does not strictly distinguish them, the word and
 * concept of "snapshot" is still important, so it is recommended to understand
 * the concept of "snapshot" properly.
