/**
 * Application of LLM function calling.
 *
 * `ILlmApplication` is a data structure representing a collection of
 * {@link ILlmFunction LLM function calling schemas}, composed from a native
 * TypeScript class (or interface) type by the `typia.llm.application<App>()`
 * function.
 *
 * By the way, the LLM function calling application composition, converting
 * `ILlmApplication` instance from TypeScript interface (or class) type is not always
 * successful. As LLM provider like OpenAI cannot understand the recursive reference
 * type that is embodied by {@link OpenApi.IJsonSchema.IReference}, if there're some
 * recursive types in the TypeScript interface (or class) type, the conversion would
 * be failed.
 *
 * Also, there can be some parameters (or their nested properties) which must be
 * composed by Human, not by LLM. File uploading feature or some sensitive information
 * like secrety key (password) are the examples. In that case, you can separate the
 * function parameters to both LLM and human sides by configuring the
 * {@link ILlmApplication.IOptions.separate} property. The separated parameters are
 * assigned to the {@link ILlmFunction.separated} property.
 *
 * For reference, when both LLM and Human filled parameter values to call, you can
 * merge them by calling the {@link HttpLlm.mergeParameters} function. In other words,
 * if you've configured the {@link ILlmApplication.IOptions.separate} property, you
 * have to merge the separated parameters before the funtion call execution.

     * to be a human composing the value, and `false` means to LLM
     * composing the value. Also, when predicating the schema, it would
     * better to utilize the {@link LlmTypeChecker} features.
