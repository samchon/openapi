   * Accessor for the route.
   *
   * The `accessor` is a list of string values that are representing how to
   * access to the OpenAPI generated RPC (Remote Procedure Call) function
   * through namespace(s).
   *
   * The `accessor` is composed with the following rules. At first, namespaces
   * are composed by static directory names in the {@link path}. Parametric
   * symbols represented by `:param` or `{param}` cannot be a part of the
   * namespace.
   *
   * Instead, they would be a part of the function name. The function
   * name is composed with the {@link method HTTP method} and parametric symbols
   * like `getByParam` or `postByParam`. If there are multiple path parameters,
   * they would be concatenated by `And` like `getByParam1AndParam2`.
   *
   * For refefence, if the {@link operation}'s {@link method} is `delete`, the
   * function name would be replaced to `erase` instead of `delete`. It is
   * the reason why the `delete` is a reserved keyword in many programming
   * languages.
   *
   * - Example 1
   *   - path: `POST /shopping/sellers/sales`
   *   - accessor: `shopping.sellers.sales.post`
   * - Example 2
   *   - endpoint: `GET /shoppings/sellers/sales/:saleId/reviews/:reviewId/comments/:id
   *   - accessor: `shoppings.sellers.sales.reviews.getBySaleIdAndReviewIdAndCommentId`
